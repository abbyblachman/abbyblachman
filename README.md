Welcome to my portfolio. 

*About my portfolio*

I am using this portfolio to showcase my work, and also to showcase my ability to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a functional website. 

The HTML for this project is not semantic. 

The CSS for this project, stored in the CSS file, is a model example of what would be expected from industry professionals. It outlines a mobile-responsive site. 

I commented out much of my thoughtprocess, so feel free to check that out in the code.
